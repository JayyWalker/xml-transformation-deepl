        <drop_caps>AHEAD</drop_caps> OF THE</scaps> general election that concluded on June 1st Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, was expected to romp home. His charisma, combined with an emphasis on infrastructure development, welfare payments to the poorest and a polarising Hindu nationalism, looked unbeatable. Mr Modi exuded a confidence that matched those predictions. He claimed that his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies would win upwards of 400 seats in the 543-seat parliament.    </text>

      <external_link>Final results</external_link> from the vote count on June 4th revealed that Mr Modi’s alliance fell well below that target. The BJP and its allies won 292 seats, compared with the opposition’s 234. The BJP itself lost 63 seats compared with the last election in 2019, ending with a tally of 240, down from 303 in 2019. Crucially, that means that it will rely on its alliance partners to control parliament (272 seats are needed for a majority). Final results are expected late on Tuesday or early on Wednesday. The spectacle of the Modi machine faltering has shocked the public, the political world and financial markets: the country’s benchmark share index fell by 6%.  	    </text>
